# Introduction

A quick and dirty docker container including [mdbook-pandoc](https://github.com/max-heller/mdbook-pandoc) and all of it's dependencies.

# Usage

**Build the container:**
`docker build -t mdbook-pandoc .`
This will take a while and result in a ~5GB container. A good proportion of this being texlive-fonts-extra. Future versions will attempt to shrink the container size.

**Run the container**

The container can be run using the following command:
`docker run -v ./my-first-book:/book mdbook`
Currently, the book's source code is volume mounted into the container (in this case ./my-first-book).
The rendered file is generated here `<book>/book/pandoc/pdf/output.pdf`. Currently, all files generated by the container are owned by root, this will be fixed in a future version.
